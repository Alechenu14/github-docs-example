# Writing Good Documentation

## Step 1 - Using Codeblocks

Codeblocks in markdown make it easy for tech people to copy, paste, share code.
A good Cloud Engineer uses Codeblocks whenever possible.

Because it allows others to copy and paste their code to replicate or research issues.

```
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Test the factorial function
number = 5
result = factorial(number)
print(f"The factorial of {number} is {result}")

```
